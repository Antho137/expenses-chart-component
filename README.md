### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- bootstrap
- Chart.js - JS library

### What I learned

The major learnings while working through this project was the use of Chart.js library. It was my first time, and to implement it accordly in the first was not easy. I was to change diferent versions up to get to the last one with which I finished the project. Of course, this experience reinforces my own knowledge on how to consider the use of libraries to speed up some process while developing projects.

### Continued development

In the future projects, I would like to refine my knowledge with fetching and promises (JS). Also, I'll try to code with React.js which I am looking to be comfortable with.

### Useful resources

- https://www.stackoverflow.com
This site helped me to fix many issues I encoutered while looked for solutions. Even some time, I was to check others sites to find what I expected, but stackoverflow was the one I most consulted. So, I'd like to recommend it to anyone who are looking for the ways to resolve some coding issues.
